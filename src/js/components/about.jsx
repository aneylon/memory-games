      <p>
        I have been part of a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/ibg/research/human-research-studies/colorado-adoption-project">study</a> since I was born. Every few years we take a series of tests and answer a variety of questions.

        These games are similar to some of the ones that are part of that study.
